All-in-one script for keeping up-to-date with the [MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki) ecosystem.

This script runs the [__MiSTer Downloader__](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Downloader_MiSTer/) tool configured with the following databases:
1. __Main Distribution__. Downloads most essential files, including cores and firmware. You are able to select between two versions:
    * The [official MiSTer Distribution](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Distribution_MiSTer) in the [MiSTer-devel](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel) organization. **[Default option]**
    * The [DB9 Fork MiSTer Distribution](https://github.com/MiSTer-DB9/Distribution_MiSTer) with [Extended Native Controller Compatibility](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/wiki#extended-native-controller-compatibility) for Genesis and NeoGeo/Supergun controllers. *Requires [SNAC8](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/wiki#snac8) compatible adapter.*
2. __JTCORES for MiSTer__. Downloads many cores made by [Jotego](https://github.com/jotego). You may select between two versions:
    * [JTSTABLE](https://github.com/JTFPGA/JTSTABLE). Stable cores only. **[Default option]**
    * [jtbin](https://github.com/jotego/jtcores_mister). Stable + Beta cores in their latest versions.
4. [theypsilon Unofficial Distribution](https://github.com/theypsilon/Unofficial_Distribution_MiSTer/tree/main). Downloads [some cores](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/wiki) that are not yet released but are fairly stable. **[Disabled by default]**
5. [LLAPI Folder](https://github.com/MiSTer-LLAPI/LLAPI_folder_MiSTer). Downloads [LLAPI cores](https://github.com/MiSTer-LLAPI/Updater_script_MiSTer/wiki) which are compatible with BlisSTer and [LLAMA](https://github.com/bootsector/LLAMA). **[Disabled by default]**
6. [Arcade Offset](https://github.com/atrac17/Arcade_Offset). Downloads patched arcade games curated by [atrac17](https://github.com/atrac17). **[Disabled by default]**
7. [Names TXT](https://github.com/ThreepwoodLeBrush/Names_MiSTer). Downloads a complete names.txt file curated by [Threepwood](https://github.com/ThreepwoodLeBrush) that enables better core names in the menus. **[Disabled by default]**

Additionally, this script also chains the following scripts:
1. [BIOS Getter](https://github.com/theypsilon/MiSTer_BIOS_SCRIPTS) download bios for your installed systems from https://archive.org/
2. [MAME and HBMAME Getter](https://github.com/atrac17/MiSTer_MAME_SCRIPTS) download roms from https://archive.org/
3. [Arcade Organizer](https://github.com/theypsilon/_arcade-organizer). Creates a folder structure under `_Arcade/_Organized` for easy navigation to all the MRA files.

Special thanks to [Locutus73](https://github.com/Locutus73) for all his great work on the older [__Updater script__](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Updater_script_MiSTer). That __Updater script__ is no longer used by __Update All__ by default.


## Setup

Download this [ZIP file](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/releases/latest/download/update_all.zip) and extract `update_all.sh` to your `/Scripts` folder on your primary SD card.

Then turn on your __MiSTer__, go to the _Scripts_ menu and run this script from there.

It will take around 30 minutes the first time you run it, but later runs should take much less time.



## Alternative Setups

Other setups that might be useful for you:
- [JTBIN ZIP](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/releases/latest/download/update_all_jtbin.zip): Users that would like to download @jotego betas by default, can use this setup instead. You may also enable this option from the `Settings Screen` in the "Jotego Updater" submenu.
- [usb0 ZIP](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/releases/latest/download/update_all_usb0.zip): For people using USB as primary storage. You will be able to run this script from there and install all cores, roms, and MRAs on `/media/usb0`.
- [DB9/SNAC8 ZIP](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/releases/latest/download/update_all_db9_snac8.zip): Enables [Extended Native Controller Compatibility](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/wiki#extended-native-controller-compatibility) for Genesis and NeoGeo/Supergun controllers.


NOTE: You should extract also all the INI files contained in these.



## MiSTer Offline Setup

Check [updater-pc](./updater-pc) to download all the MiSTer files from your PC.

Useful if you can't connect your MiSTer to internet.



## Further Configuration

In case you would like to configure Update All so it downloads exactly what you need, you can do it through the Settings screen.

![settings screen](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/raw/master/setups/menu-1-4.jpeg "Settings Screen")

The Settings screen will show up if you press UP in your controller or keyboard during the countdown showing up right after starting `update_all.sh` in your MiSTer. Please, don't forget to select `SAVE` to keep all the changes you have done before leaving.
